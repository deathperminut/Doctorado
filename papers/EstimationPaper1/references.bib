  abstract = {Summary Ultrasound guidance is becoming standard practice for needle-based interventions in anaesthetic practice, such as vascular access and peripheral nerve blocks. However, difficulties in aligning the needle and the transducer can lead to incorrect identification of the needle tip, possibly damaging structures not visible on the ultrasound screen. Additional techniques specifically developed to aid alignment of needle and probe or identification of the needle tip are now available. In this scoping review, advantages and limitations of the following categories of those solutions are presented: needle guides; alterations to needle or needle tip; three- and four-dimensional ultrasound; magnetism, electromagnetic or GPS systems; optical tracking; augmented (virtual) reality; robotic assistance; and automated (computerised) needle detection. Most evidence originates from phantom studies, case reports and series, with few randomised clinical trials. Improved first-pass success and reduced performance time are the most frequently cited benefits, whereas the need for additional and often expensive hardware is the greatest limitation to widespread adoption. Novice ultrasound users seem to benefit most and great potential lies in education. Future research should focus on reporting relevant clinical parameters to learn which technique will benefit patients most in terms of success and safety.},

  abstract  = {The identification of nerve structures is a crucial issue in the field of anesthesiology. Recently, ultrasound images have become relevant for performing Peripheral Nerve Blocking (PNB) procedures since it offers a non-invasive visualization of the nerve and the anatomical structures around it. However, the location of nerve structures from ultrasound images is a difficult task for the specialist due to the artifacts, i.e., speckle noise, which affect the intelligibility of a given image. Here, we proposed an automatic nerve structure segmentation approach from ultrasound images based on random under-sampling (RUS) and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In particular, we use a Graph Cuts-based technique to define a region of interest (ROI). Then, such an ROI is split into several correlated areas (superpixels) using the well-known Simple Linear Iterative Clustering algorithm. Further, a nonlinear Wavelet transform is applied to extract relevant features. Afterward, we use a classification scheme based on RUS and SVM to predict the label of each parametrized superpixel. Thus, our approach can deal with the imbalance issues when classifying a superpixel as nerve or non-nerve. Attained results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms similar works regarding both the dice segmentation coefficient and the geometric mean-based classification assessment.},

% Papers RFF and Kernel Method vs Deep Learning
@article{Mohammadnia2018,
  abstract  = {Convolutional Kernel Networks (CKNs) are efficient multilayer kernel machines, which are constructed by approximating a convolution kernel with a mapping based on Gaussian functions. In this paper, we introduce a new approximation of the same convolution kernel based on a convex combination of cosine kernels. CKNs are structurally similar to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but the convolution operation in CKNs is based on the Euclidean distance, which is not common in convolutional networks. We show that the CKN model obtained by the proposed approximation leads to the ordinary convolution operation, which is based on the inner product. From this point of view, the proposed model is a step forward towards bridging the gap between kernel methods and deep learning. In this paper, we use two methods for learning filters of the proposed CKN: Random Fourier Features, which is a randomized data-independent method for approximating shift-invariant kernels, and a novel method based on the minimization of the sum of squared errors of approximating shift-invariant kernels. Although the RFF method is much faster than ordinary CKN, it requires a high number of random features in order to obtain an acceptable accuracy. To overcome this problem, we proposed the second method, in which the filters are learned in a data-dependent fashion. We evaluate the proposed model on visual recognition datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, C-Cube, and FERET. Our experiments show that the proposed model surpasses ordinary CKNs in terms of accuracy. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, the accuracy of the proposed method is 1.7% higher than ordinary CKN.},

However, despite impressive empirical results, the statistical properties of random Fourier features are still not well understood. In this paper we take steps toward filling this gap. Specifically, we approach random Fourier features from a spectral matrix approximation point of view, give tight bounds on the number of Fourier features required to achieve a spectral approximation, and show how spectral matrix approximation bounds imply statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression.}

  abstract = {PCANet is an unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to learn convolutional filters. One drawback of PCANet is that linear PCA cannot capture nonlinear structures within data. To address this problem, a straightforward approach is utilizing kernel methods by equipping the PCA method in PCANet with a kernel function. However, this practice leads to a network having cubic complexity with respect to the number of training image patches. In this paper, we propose a network called Randomized Nonlinear PCANet (RNPCANet), which uses an explicit kernel PCA to learn the convolutional filters. Although RNPCANet utilizes kernel methods for nonlinear processing of data, using kernel approximation techniques to define an explicit feature space in each stage, we theoretically show that the complexity of this model is not much higher than that of PCANet. We also show that our method links PCANets to Convolutional Kernel Networks (CKNs) as the proposed model maps the patches to a kernel feature space similar to CKNs. We evaluate our model on image recognition tasks including Coil-20, Coil-100, ETH-80, Caltech-101, MNIST, and C-Cube datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method has superiority over PCANet and CKNs in terms of recognition accuracy.}

  abstract  = {Low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy is commonly used to treat early stage prostate cancer. This intervention involves implanting radioactive seeds inside a volume containing the prostate. Planning the intervention requires obtaining a series of ultrasound images from the prostate. This is followed by delineation of a clinical target volume, which mostly traces the prostate boundary in the ultrasound data, but can be modified based on institution-specific clinical guidelines. Here, we aim to automate the delineation of clinical target volume by using a new deep learning network based on residual neural nets and dilated convolution at deeper layers. In addition, we propose to include an exponential weight map in the optimization to improve local prediction. We train the network on 4,284 expert-labeled transrectal ultrasound images and test it on an independent set of 1,081 ultrasound images. With respect to the gold-standard delineation, we achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 94{\%}, a mean surface distance error of 1.05mm and a mean Hausdorff distance error of 3.0mm. The obtained results are statistically significantly better than two previous state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract       = {An image semantic segmentation algorithm using fully convolutional network (FCN) integrated with the recently proposed simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) that is based on boundary term (BSLIC) is developed. To improve the segmentation accuracy, the developed algorithm combines the FCN semantic segmentation results with the superpixel information acquired by BSLIC. During the combination process, the superpixel semantic annotation is newly introduced and realized by the four criteria. The four criteria are used to annotate a superpixel region, according to FCN semantic segmentation result. The developed algorithm can not only accurately identify the semantic information of the target in the image, but also achieve a high accuracy in the positioning of small edges. The effectiveness of our algorithm is evaluated on the dataset PASCAL VOC 2012. Experimental results show that the developed algorithm improved the target segmentation accuracy in comparison with the traditional FCN model. With the BSLIC superpixel information that is involved, the proposed algorithm can get 3.86%, 1.41%, and 1.28% improvement in pixel accuracy (PA) over FCN-32s, FCN-16s, and FCN-8s, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound (US) medical imaging rises as a technique used to visualize nerve structures, among other applications. It has been used, typically, as a tool for assisting in the practice of peripheral nerve anesthesia. Due to its non-invasive nature, US may reduce the risk of injury to medical patients during surgical procedures. Despite its usefulness, it is challenging for anesthesiologists to perform the anesthesia process, mainly due to the presence of speckle and acoustic multiplicative noise, significantly degrading the image quality. Besides, the lack of homogeneity in the imaged structures disorients the anesthesiologist in the effective localization of the nerve structure. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the software toolkit HAPAN (HAPAN is a Spanish acronym for Herramienta de Asistencia para la Pr{\'a}ctica de Anestesia en Nervios perif{\'e}ricos-Assistance tool for the anesthesia of peripheral nerves.), developed in MATLAB, for the segmentation of different peripheral nerves in ultrasound images. HAPAN includes algorithms for automatic nerve segmentation based on appearance shape models, and image resolution enhancement.},

  abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome commonly occurs in individuals working in occupations that involve use of vibrating manual tools or tasks with highly repetitive and forceful manual exertion. In recent years, carpal tunnel syndrome has been evaluated by ultrasound imaging that monitors median nerve movement. Conventional image analysis methods, such as the active contour model, are typically used to expedite automatic segmentation of the median nerve, but these usually suffer from an arduous manual intervention. We propose a new convolutional neural network framework for localization and segmentation of the median nerve, called DeepNerve, that is based on the U-Net model. DeepNerve integrates the characteristics of MaskTrack and convolutional long short-term memory to effectively locate and segment the median nerve. On the basis of experimental results, the proposed model achieved high performance and generated average Dice measurement, precision, recall and F-score values of 0.8975, 0.8912, 0.9119 and 0.9015, respectively. The segmentation results of DeepNerve were significantly improved in comparison with those of conventional active contour models. Additionally, the results of Student's t-test revealed significant differences in four deformation measurements of the median nerve, including area, perimeter, aspect ratio and circularity. We conclude that the proposed DeepNerve not only generates satisfactory results for localization and segmentation of the median nerve, but also creates more promising measurements for applications in clinical carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis.}

                   Abstract
                   Medical image analysis is performed by analyzing images obtained by medical imaging systems to solve clinical problems. The purpose is to extract effective information and improve the level of clinical diagnosis. In recent years, automatic segmentation based on deep
                   learning (DL) methods has been widely used, where a neural network can automatically learn image features, which is in sharp contrast with the traditional manual learning method. U-net is one of the most important semantic segmentation frameworks for a convolutional neural network (CNN). It
                   is widely used in the medical image analysis domain for lesion segmentation, anatomical segmentation, and classification. The advantage of this network framework is that it can not only accurately segment the desired feature target and effectively process and objectively evaluate medical images
                   but also help to improve accuracy in the diagnosis by medical images. Therefore, this article presents a literature review of medical image segmentation based on U-net, focusing on the successful segmentation experience of U-net for different lesion regions in six medical imaging systems.
                   Along with the latest advances in DL, this article introduces the method of combining the original U-net architecture with deep learning and a method for improving the U-net network.}

The underlying Multi U-net algorithm is based on convolutional neural networks. Under the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board protocol, a prospective study of the automatic segmentation of suspicious breast masses was performed. The cohort consisted of 258 female patients who were clinically identified with suspicious breast masses and underwent clinical US scan and breast biopsy. The computer-aided detection tool effectively segmented the breast masses, achieving a mean Dice coefficient of 0.82, a true positive fraction (TPF) of 0.84, and a false positive fraction (FPF) of 0.01. By avoiding positioning of an initial seed, the algorithm is able to segment images in real time (13–55 ms per image), and can have potential clinical applications. The algorithm is at par with a conventional seeded algorithm, which had a mean Dice coefficient of 0.84 and performs significantly better (P< 0.0001) than the original U-net algorithm.},

  abstract       = {This paper mainly deals with the problem of short text classification. There are two main contributions. Firstly, we introduce a framework of deep uniform kernel mapping support vector machine (DUKMSVM). The significant merit of this framework is that by expressing the kernel mapping function explicitly with a deep neural network, it is in essence an explicit kernel mapping instead of the traditional kernel function, and it allows better flexibility in dealing with various applications by applying different neural network structures. Secondly, to validate the effectiveness of this framework and to improve the performance of short text classification, we explicitly express the kernel mapping using bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN), and propose a deep bidirectional recurrent kernel mapping support vector machine (DRKMSVM) for short text classification. Experimental results on five public short text classification datasets indicate that in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall rate and F1-score, the DRKMSVM achieves the best performance with the average values of accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1-score of 87.23%, 86.99%, 86.13% and 86.51% respectively compared to traditional SVM, convolutional neural network (CNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Deep Neural Mapping Support Vector Machine (DNMSVM) which applies multi-layer perceptron for kernel mapping.},

  abstract  = {There has been much interest in unsupervised learning of hierarchical generative models
               such as deep belief networks. Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional
               images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional
               deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image
               sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down
               probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel
               technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically
               sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual
               features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes.
               We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show
               that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized
               images.},

  abstract = {Efficient and accurate semantic segmentation is particularly important in scene understanding for autonomous driving. Although Deep Convolutional Neural Networks(DCNNs) approaches have made a significant improvement for semantic segmentation. However, state-of-the-art models such as Deeplab and PSPNet have complex architectures and high computation complexity. Thus, it is inefficient for realtime applications. On the other hand, many works compromise the performance to obtain real-time inference speed which is critical for developing a light network model with high segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient network named DSANet, which follows a two-branch strategy to tackle the problem of real-time semantic segmentation in urban scenes. We first design a Semantic Encoding Branch, which employs channel split and shuffle to reduce the computation and maintain higher segmentation accuracy. Also, we propose a dual attention module consisting of dilated spatial attention and channel attention to make full use of the multi-level feature maps simultaneously, which helps predict the pixel-wise labels in each stage. Meanwhile, Spatial Encoding Network is used to enhance semantic information and preserve the spatial details. To better combine context information and spatial information, we introduce a Simple Feature Fusion Module. We evaluated our model with state-of-the-art semantic image semantic segmentation methods using two challenging datasets. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 69.9% mean IoU and 71.3% mean IoU at speed of 75.3 fps and 34.08 fps on CamVid and Cityscapes test datasets respectively.}

This model is based on U-Net, and its structure has been modified to improve the performance of the algorithm. There are three aspects of improvement based on U-Net, including E-Res layer, dilated convolution module, and E-Res path. Additional experiments demonstrate that each designed module in our proposed network is effective, can improve the accuracy compared to the original U-Net. When compared with other algorithms which are state-of-the-art, the experimental result under the overall network structure is even more excellent.}
